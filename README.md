# About this repository
This is a demo repository to accompany the blog post at http://vjeko.com/accessing-a-control-add-in-in-a-dependency-extension/
All of the code examples explained in this blog post are contained in this repository.

## BaseExtension
This folder contains the base extension, the one that exposes the control add-in that can be used from other extensions.

## ConsumerExtension
This folder contains the extension that depends on the control add-in defined in BaseExtension and consumes its control add-in.

# What can I do with this?
How should I know? :)
You are free to do anything as you please, I don't put any restrictions on this code. It's copyleft.
